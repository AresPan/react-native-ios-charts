# react-native-ios-charts

Bringing [iOS Charts](https://github.com/danielgindi/ios-charts) to React Native.

# Introduction

The aim of this library is to provide reusable React Native components that can graph charts like Bar, Line, Scatter, Combined, Pie, Candle, Bubble from the awesome ios-charts library.

# Installation

TODO

# Usage

As of this point, BarChart and LineChart are currently supported. Support for more graphs will be coming along the way.

# Contributing

Anyone who is willing to help developing this library is welcomed! I am not a swift guy as you may see by my code that is horrible. You may either create an issue or contact me directly.

# Roadmap
